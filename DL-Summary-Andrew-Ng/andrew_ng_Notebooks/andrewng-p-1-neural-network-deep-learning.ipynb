    "  - Image taken from [opennn.net](opennn.net)\n",
    "- Each Input will be connected to the hidden layer and the NN will decide the connections.\n",
    "- Supervised learning means we have the (X,Y) and we need to get the function that maps X to Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning with neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different types of neural networks for supervised learning which includes:\n",
    "  - CNN or convolutional neural networks (Useful in computer vision)\n",
    "  - RNN or Recurrent neural networks (Useful in Speech recognition or NLP)\n",
    "  - Standard NN (Useful for Structured data)\n",
    "  - Hybrid/custom NN or a Collection of NNs types\n",
    "- Structured data is like the databases and tables.\n",
    "- Unstructured data is like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/1-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Images/, video, audio, and text.\n",
    "- Structured data gives more money because companies relies on prediction on its big data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is deep learning taking off?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep learning is taking off for 3 reasons:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Mainly he is talking about how to do a logistic regression to make a binary classifier.\n",
    "  - ![log](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/1-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Images//Others/03.png)\n",
    "  - Image taken from [3.bp.blogspot.com](http://3.bp.blogspot.com)\n",
    "- He talked about an example of knowing if the current image contains a cat or not.\n",
    "- Here are some notations:\n",
    "  - `M is the number of training vectors`\n",
    "  - `Nx is the size of the input vector`\n",
    "  - `Ny is the size of the output vector`\n",
    "  - `X(1) is the first input vector`\n",
    "  - `Y(1) is the first output vector`\n",
    "  - `X = [x(1) x(2).. x(M)]`\n",
    "  - `Y = (y(1) y(2).. y(M))`\n",
    "- We will use python in this course.\n",
    "- In NumPy we can make matrices and make operations on them in a fast and reliable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm is used for classification algorithm of 2 classes.\n",
    "- Equations:\n",
    "  - Simple equation:\t`y = wx + b`\n",
    "  - If x is a vector: `y = w(transpose)x + b`\n",
    "  - If we need y to be in between 0 and 1 (probability): `y = sigmoid(w(transpose)x + b)`\n",
    "  - In some notations this might be used: `y = sigmoid(w(transpose)x)` \n",
    "    - While `b` is `w0` of `w` and we add `x0 = 1`. but we won't use this notation in the course (Andrew said that the first notation is better).\n",
    "- In binary classification `Y` has to be between `0` and `1`.\n",
    "- In the last equation `w` is a vector of `Nx` and `b` is a real number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic regression cost function\n",
    "\n",
    "- First loss function would be the square root error:  `L(y',y) = 1/2 (y' - y)^2`\n",
    "  - But we won't use this notation because it leads us to optimization problem which is non convex, means it contains local optimum points.\n",
    "- This is the function that we will use: `L(y',y) = - (y*log(y') + (1-y)*log(1-y'))`\n",
    "- To explain the last function lets see:\n",
    "  - if `y = 1` ==> `L(y',1) = -log(y')`  ==> we want `y'` to be the largest   ==> `y`' biggest value is 1\n",
    "  - if `y = 0` ==> `L(y',0) = -log(1-y')` ==> we want `1-y'` to be the largest ==> `y'` to be smaller as possible because it can only has 1 value.\n",
    "- Then the Cost function will be: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y'[i],y[i]))`\n",
    "- The loss function computes the error for a single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss functions of the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "- We want to predict `w` and `b` that minimize the cost function.\n",
    "- Our cost function is convex.\n",
    "- First we initialize `w` and `b` to 0,0 or initialize them to a random value in the convex function and then try to improve the values the reach minimum value.\n",
    "- In Logistic regression people always use 0,0 instead of random.\n",
    "- The gradient decent algorithm repeats: `w = w - alpha * dw`\n",
    "  where alpha is the learning rate and `dw` is the derivative of `w` (Change to `w`) \n",
    "  The derivative is also the slope of `w`\n",
    "- Looks like greedy algorithms. the derivative give us the direction to improve our parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The actual equations we will implement:\n",
    "  - `w = w - alpha * d(J(w,b) / dw)`        (how much the function slopes in the w direction)\n",
    "  - `b = b - alpha * d(J(w,b) / db)`        (how much the function slopes in the d direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will talk about some of required calculus.\n",
    "- You don't need to be a calculus geek to master deep learning but you'll need some skills from it.\n",
    "- Derivative of a linear line is its slope.\n",
    "  - ex. `f(a) = 3a`                    `d(f(a))/d(a) = 3`\n",
    "  - if `a = 2` then `f(a) = 6`\n",
    "  - if we move a a little bit `a = 2.001` then `f(a) = 6.003` means that we multiplied the derivative (Slope) to the moved area and added it to the last result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Derivatives examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- `f(a) = a^2`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 2a`\n",
    "  - `a = 2`  ==> `f(a) = 4`\n",
    "  - `a = 2.0001` ==> `f(a) = 4.0004` approx.\n",
    "- `f(a) = a^3`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 3a^2`\n",
    "- `f(a) = log(a)`  ==> `d(f(a))/d(a) = 1/a`\n",
    "- To conclude, Derivative is the slope and slope is different in different points in the function thats why the derivative is a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computation graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its a graph that organizes the computation from left to right.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Calculus chain rule says:\n",
    "  If `x -> y -> z`          (x effect y and y effects z)\n",

    "- `dvar` means the derivatives of a final output variable with respect to various intermediate quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression Gradient Descent\n",

    "### Notes on Python and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- In NumPy, `obj.sum(axis = 0)` sums the columns while `obj.sum(axis = 1)` sums the rows.\n",
    "- In NumPy, `obj.reshape(1,4)` changes the shape of the matrix by broadcasting the values.\n",
    "- Reshape is cheap in calculations so put it everywhere you're not sure about the calculations.\n",
    "- Broadcasting works when you do a matrix operation with matrices that doesn't match for the operation, in this case NumPy automatically makes the shapes ready for the operation by broadcasting the values.\n",
    "- In general principle of broadcasting. If you have an (m,n) matrix and you add(+) or subtract(-) or multiply(*) or divide(/) with a (1,n) matrix, then this will copy it m times into an (m,n) matrix. The same with if you use those operations with a (m , 1) matrix, then this will copy it n times into (m, n) matrix. And then apply the addition, subtraction, and multiplication of division element wise.\n",
    "- Some tricks to eliminate all the strange bugs in the code:\n",
    "  - If you didn't specify the shape of a vector, it will take a shape of `(m,)` and the transpose operation won't work. You have to reshape it to `(m, 1)`\n",
    "  - Try to not use the rank one matrix in ANN\n",
    "  - Don't hesitate to use `assert(a.shape == (5,1))` to check if your matrix shape is the required one.\n",
    "  - If you've found a rank one matrix try to run reshape on it.\n",
    "- Jupyter / IPython notebooks are so useful library in python that makes it easy to integrate code and document at the same time. It runs in the browser and doesn't need an IDE to run.\n",
    "  - To open Jupyter Notebook, open the command line and call: `jupyter-notebook` It should be installed to work.\n",

    "    `A = np.tanh(z)   # Where z is the input matrix`\n",
    "- It turns out that the tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer.\n",
    "- Sigmoid or Tanh function disadvantage is that if the input is too small or too high, the slope will be near zero which will cause us the gradient decent problem.\n",
    "- One of the popular activation functions that solved the slow gradient decent is the RELU function.\n",
    "  `RELU = max(0,z) # so if z is negative the slope is 0 and if z is positive the slope remains linear.`\n",
    "- So here is some basic rule for choosing activation functions, if your classification is between 0 and 1, use the output activation as sigmoid and the others as RELU.\n",
    "- Leaky RELU activation function different of RELU is that if the input is negative the slope will be so small. It works as RELU but most people uses RELU.\n",
    "  `Leaky_RELU = max(0.01z,z)  #the 0.01 can be a parameter for your algorithm.`\n",
    "- In NN you will decide a lot of choices like:\n",

    "  - No of neurons in each hidden layer.\n",
    "  - Learning rate.       (The most important parameter)\n",
