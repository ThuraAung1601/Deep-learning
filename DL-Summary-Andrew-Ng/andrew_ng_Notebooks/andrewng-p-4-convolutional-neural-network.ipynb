    "\n",
    "> Learn to implement the foundational layers of CNNs (pooling, convolutions) and to stack them properly in a deep network to solve multi-class image classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computer vision\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computer vision is one of the applications that are rapidly active thanks to deep learning.\n",
    "- Some of the applications of computer vision that are using deep learning includes:\n",
    "  - Self driving cars.\n",
    "  - Face recognition.\n",
    "- Deep learning is also enabling new types of art to be created.\n",
    "- Rapid changes to computer vision are making new applications that weren't possible a few years ago.\n",
    "- Computer vision deep leaning techniques are always evolving making a new architectures which can help us in other areas other than computer vision.\n",
    "  - For example, Andrew Ng took some ideas of computer vision and applied it in speech recognition.\n",
    "- Examples of a computer vision problems includes:\n",
    "  - Image classification.\n",
    "  - Object detection.\n",
    "    - Detect object and localize them.\n",
    "  - Neural style transfer\n",
    "    - Changes the style of an image using another image.\n",
    "- One of the challenges of computer vision problem that https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images/ can be so large and we want a fast and accurate algorithm to work with that.\n",
    "  - For example, a `1000x1000` image will represent 3 million feature/input to the full connected neural network. If the following hidden layer contains 1000, then we will want to learn weights of the shape `[1000, 3 million]` which is 3 billion parameter only in the first layer and thats so computationally expensive!\n",
    "- One of the solutions is to build this using **convolution layers** instead of the **fully connected layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Edge detection example\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolution operation is one of the fundamentals blocks of a CNN. One of the examples about convolution is the image edge detection operation.\n",
    "- Early layers of CNN might detect edges then the middle layers will detect parts of objects and the later layers will put the these parts together to produce an output.\n",
    "- In an image we can detect vertical edges, horizontal edges, or full edge detector.\n",
    "- Vertical edge detection:\n",
    "  - An example of convolution operation to detect vertical edges:\n",
    "    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images//01.png)\n",
    "  - In the last example a `6x6` matrix convolved with `3x3` filter/kernel gives us a `4x4` matrix.\n",
    "  - If you make the convolution operation in TensorFlow you will find the function `tf.nn.conv2d`. In keras you will find `Conv2d` function.\n",
    "  - The vertical edge detection filter will find a `3x3` place in an image where there are a bright region followed by a dark region.\n",
    "  - If we applied this filter to a white region followed by a dark region, it should find the edges in between the two colors as a positive value. But if we applied the same filter to a dark region followed by a white region it will give us negative values. To solve this we can use the abs function to make it positive.\n",
    "- Horizontal edge detection\n",
    "  - Filter would be like this\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    1\t1\t1\n",
    "    0\t0\t0\n",
    "    -1\t-1\t-1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a lot of ways we can put number inside the horizontal or vertical edge detections. For example here are the vertical **Sobel** filter (The idea is taking care of the middle row):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  1\t0\t-1\n",
    "  2\t0\t-2\n",
    "  1\t0\t-1\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also something called **Scharr** filter (The idea is taking great care of the middle row):\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  3\t0\t-3\n",
    "  10\t0\t-10\n",
    "  3\t0\t-3\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- What we learned in the deep learning is that we don't need to hand craft these numbers, we can treat them as weights and then learn them. It can learn horizontal, vertical, angled, or any edge type automatically rather than getting them by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to to use deep neural networks we really need to use **paddings**.\n",
    "- In the last section we saw that a `6x6` matrix convolved with `3x3` filter/kernel gives us a `4x4` matrix.\n",
    "- To give it a general rule, if a matrix `nxn` is convolved with `fxf` filter/kernel give us `n-f+1,n-f+1` matrix. \n",
    "- The convolution operation shrinks the matrix if f>1.\n",
    "- We want to apply convolution operation multiple times, but if the image shrinks we will lose a lot of data on this process. Also the edges pixels are used less than other pixels in an image.\n",
    "- So the problems with convolutions are:\n",
    "  - Shrinks output.\n",
    "  - throwing away a lot of information that are in the edges.\n",
    "- To solve these problems we can pad the input image before convolution by adding some rows and columns to it. We will call the padding amount `P` the number of row/columns that we will insert in top, bottom, left and right of the image.\n",
    "- In almost all the cases the padding values are zeros.\n",
    "- The general rule now,  if a matrix `nxn` is convolved with `fxf` filter/kernel and padding `p` give us `n+2p-f+1,n+2p-f+1` matrix. \n",
    "- If n = 6, f = 3, and p = 1 Then the output image will have `n+2p-f+1 = 6+2-3+1 = 6`. We maintain the size of the image.\n",
    "- Same convolutions is a convolution with a pad so that output size is the same as the input size. Its given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  P = (f-1) / 2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In computer vision f is usually odd. Some of the reasons is that its have a center value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strided convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strided convolution is another piece that are used in CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will call stride `S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we are making the convolution operation we used `S` to tell us the number of pixels we will jump when we are convolving filter/kernel. The last examples we described S was 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now the general rule are:\n",
    "  -  if a matrix `nxn` is convolved with `fxf` filter/kernel and padding `p` and stride `s` it give us `(n+2p-f)/s + 1,(n+2p-f)/s + 1` matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In case `(n+2p-f)/s + 1` is fraction we can take **floor** of this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In math textbooks the conv operation is filpping the filter before using it. What we were doing is called cross-correlation operation but the state of art of deep learning is using this as conv operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Same convolutions is a convolution with a padding so that output size is the same as the input size. Its given by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  p = (n*s - n + f - s) / 2\n",
    "  When s = 1 ==> P = (f-1) / 2\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutions over volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "- We see how convolution works with 2D https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images/, now lets see if we want to convolve 3D https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images/ (RGB image)\n",
    "- We will convolve an image of height, width, # of channels with a filter of a height, width, same # of channels. Hint that the image number channels and the filter number of channels are the same.\n",
    "- We can call this as stacked filters for each channel!\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  - Input image: `6x6x3`\n",
    "  - Filter: `3x3x3`\n",
    "  - Result image: `4x4x1`\n",
    "  - In the last result p=0, s=1\n",
    "- Hint the output here is only 2D.\n",
    "- We can use multiple filters to detect multiple features or edges. Example.\n",
    "  - Input image: `6x6x3`\n",
    "  - 10 Filters: `3x3x3`\n",
    "  - Result image: `4x4x10`\n",
    "  - In the last result p=0, s=1\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Layer of a Convolutional Network\n",
    "\n",
    "- First we convolve some filters to a given input and then add a bias to each filter output and then get RELU of the result. Example:\n",
    "  - Input image: `6x6x3`         `# a0`\n",
    "  - 10 Filters: `3x3x3`         `#W1`\n",
    "  - Result image: `4x4x10`     `#W1a0`\n",
    "  - Add b (bias) with `10x1` will get us : `4x4x10` image      `#W1a0 + b`\n",
    "  - Apply RELU will get us: `4x4x10` image                `#A1 = RELU(W1a0 + b)`\n",
    "  - In the last result p=0, s=1\n",
    "  - Hint number of parameters here are: `(3x3x3x10) + 10 = 280`\n",
    "- The last example forms a layer in the CNN.\n",
    "- Hint: no matter the size of the input, the number of the parameters is same if filter size is same. That makes it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "- Here are some notations we will use. If layer l is a conv layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Hyperparameters\n",
    "  f[l] = filter size\n",
    "  p[l] = padding\t# Default is zero\n",
    "  s[l] = stride\n",
    "  nc[l] = number of filters\n",
    "\n",
    "  Input:  n[l-1] x n[l-1] x nc[l-1]\tOr\t nH[l-1] x nW[l-1] x nc[l-1]\n",
    "  Output: n[l] x n[l] x nc[l]\tOr\t nH[l] x nW[l] x nc[l]\n",
    "  Where n[l] = (n[l-1] + 2p[l] - f[l] / s[l]) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "  Each filter is: f[l] x f[l] x nc[l-1]\n",
    "\n",
    "  Activations: a[l] is nH[l] x nW[l] x nc[l]\n",
    "  \t\t     A[l] is m x nH[l] x nW[l] x nc[l]   # In batch or minbatch training\n",

    "### A simple convolution network example\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets build a big example.\n",
    "  - Input Image are:   `a0 = 39x39x3`\n",
    "    - `n0 = 39` and `nc0 = 3`\n",
    "  - First layer (Conv layer):\n",
    "    - `f1 = 3`, `s1 = 1`, and `p1 = 0`\n",
    "    - `number of filters = 10`\n",

    "      - `n2 = 17`, `nc2 = 20`\n",
    "    - Hint shrinking goes much faster because the stride is 2\n",
    "  - Third layer (Conv layer):\n",
    "    - `f3 = 5`, `s3 = 2`, `p3 = 0`\n",
    "    - `number of filters = 40`\n",

    "  - Forth layer (Fully connected Softmax)\n",
    "    - `a3 = 7x7x40 = 1960`  as a vector..\n",
    "- In the last example you seen that the image are getting smaller after each layer and thats the trend now.\n",
    "- Types of layer in a convolutional network:\n",
    "  - Convolution. \t\t`#Conv`\n",
    "  - Pooling      `#Pool`\n",
    "  - Fully connected     `#FC`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pooling layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Other than the conv layers, CNNs often uses pooling layers to reduce the size of the inputs, speed up computation, and to make some of the features it detects more robust.\n",
    "- Max pooling example:\n",
    "  - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images//02.png)\n",
    "  - This example has `f = 2`, `s = 2`, and `p = 0` hyperparameters\n",
    "- The max pooling is saying, if the feature is detected anywhere in this filter then keep a high number. But the main reason why people are using pooling because its works well in practice and reduce computations.\n",
    "- Max pooling has no parameters to learn.\n",
    "- Example of Max pooling on 3D input:\n",
    "  - Input: `4x4x10`\n",
    "  - `Max pooling size = 2` and `stride = 2`\n",
    "  - Output: `2x2x10`\n",
    "- Average pooling is taking the averages of the values instead of taking the max values.\n",
    "- Max pooling is used more often than average pooling in practice.\n",
    "- If stride of pooling equals the size, it will then apply the effect of shrinking.\n",
    "- Hyperparameters summary\n",
    "  - f : filter size.\n",
    "  - s : stride.\n",

    "### Why ResNets work\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets see some example that illustrates why resNet work.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We have a big NN as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `X --> Big NN --> a[l]`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Lets add two layers to this network as a residual block:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `X --> Big NN --> a[l] --> Layer1 --> Layer2 --> a[l+2]`\n",
    "    - And a`[l]` has a direct connection to `a[l+2]`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Suppose we are using RELU activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ```\n",
    "      a[l+2] = g( z[l+2] + a[l] )\n",
    "      \t   = g( W[l+2] a[l+1] + b[l+2] + a[l] )\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Then if we are using L2 regularization for example, `W[l+2]` will be zero. Lets say that `b[l+2]` will be zero too.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Then `a[l+2] = g( a[l] ) = a[l]` with no negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - This show that identity function is easy for a residual block to learn. And that why it can train deeper NNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Also that the two layers we added doesn't hurt the performance of big NN we made.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Hint: dimensions of z[l+2] and a[l] have to be the same in resNets. In case they have different dimensions what we put a matrix parameters (Which can be learned or fixed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - `a[l+2] = g( z[l+2] + ws * a[l] ) # The added Ws should make the dimentions equal`\n",

    "- The pretrained models might have trained on a large datasets like ImageNet, Ms COCO, or pascal and took a lot of time to learn those parameters/weights with optimized hyperparameters. This can save you a lot of time.\n",
    "- Lets see an example:\n",
    "  - Lets say you have a cat classification problem which contains 3 classes Tigger, Misty and neither.\n",

    "  - Andrew recommends to go online and download a good NN with its weights, remove the softmax activation layer and put your own one and make the network learn only the new layer while other layer weights are fixed/frozen.\n",
    "  - Frameworks have options to make the parameters frozen in some layers using `trainable = 0` or `freeze = 0`\n",
    "  - One of the tricks that can speed up your training, is to run the pretrained NN without final softmax layer and get an intermediate representation of your https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images/ and save them to disk. And then use these representation to a shallow NN network. This can save you the time needed to run an image through all the layers.\n",
    "    - Its like converting your https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/4-%20Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks/Images/ into vectors.\n",
    "- Another example:\n",
    "  - What if in the last example you have a lot of pictures for your cats.\n",
    "  - One thing you can do is to freeze few layers from the beginning of the pretrained network and learn the other weights in the network.\n",
    "  - Some other idea is to throw away the layers that aren't frozen and put your own layers there.\n",

    "- In order to implement this you need to look at the features extracted by the Conv net at the shallower and deeper layers.\n",
    "- It uses a previously trained convolutional network like VGG, and builds on top of that. The idea of using a network trained on a different task and applying it to a new task is called transfer learning.\n",

    "- Say you use hidden layer `l` to compute content cost. \n",
    "  - If we choose `l` to be small (like layer 1), we will force the network to get similar output to the original content image.\n",
