    "## Practical aspects of Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train / Dev / Test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Its impossible to get all your hyperparameters right on a new application from the first time.\n",
    "- So the idea is you go through the loop: `Idea ==> Code ==> Experiment`.\n",
    "- You have to go through the loop many times to figure out your hyperparameters.\n",
    "- Your data will be split into three parts:\n",
    "  - Training set.       (Has to be the largest set)\n",
    "  - Hold-out cross validation set / Development or \"dev\" set.\n",
    "  - Testing set.\n",
    "- You will try to build a model upon training set then try to optimize hyperparameters on dev set as much as possible. Then after your model is ready you try and evaluate the testing set.\n",
    "- so the trend on the ratio of splitting the models:\n",
    "  - If size of the  dataset is 100 to 1000000  ==> 60/20/20\n",
    "  - If size of the  dataset is 1000000  to INF  ==> 98/1/1 or  99.5/0.25/0.25\n",
    "- The trend now gives the training data the biggest sets.\n",
    "- Make sure the dev and test set are coming from the same distribution.\n",
    "  - For example if cat training pictures is from the web and the dev/test pictures are from users cell phone they will mismatch. It is better to make sure that dev and test set are from the same distribution.\n",
    "- The dev set rule is to try them on some of the good models you've created.\n",
    "- Its OK to only have a dev set without a testing set. But a lot of people in this case call the dev set as the test set. A better terminology is to call it a dev set as its used in the development.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias / Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bias / Variance techniques are Easy to learn, but difficult to master.\n",
    "- So here the explanation of Bias / Variance:\n",
    "  - If your model is underfitting (logistic regression of non linear data) it has a \"high bias\"\n",
    "  - If your model is overfitting then it has a \"high variance\"\n",
    "  - Your model will be alright if you balance the Bias / Variance\n",
    "  - For more:\n",
    "    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/2-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/Images//01-_Bias_-_Variance.png)\n",
    "- Another idea to get the bias /  variance if you don't have a 2D plotting mechanism:\n",
    "  - High variance (overfitting) for example:\n",
    "    - Training error: 1%\n",
    "    - Dev error: 11%\n",
    "  - high Bias (underfitting) for example:\n",
    "    - Training error: 15%\n",
    "    - Dev error: 14%\n",
    "  - high Bias (underfitting) && High variance (overfitting) for example:\n",
    "    - Training error: 15%\n",
    "    - Test error: 30%\n",
    "  - Best:\n",
    "    - Training error: 0.5%\n",
    "    - Test error: 1%\n",
    "  - These Assumptions came from that human has 0% error. If the problem isn't like that you'll need to use human error as baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Recipe for Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your algorithm has a high bias:\n",
    "  - Try to make your NN bigger (size of hidden units, number of layers)\n",
    "  - Try a different model that is suitable for your data.\n",
    "  - Try to run it longer.\n",
    "  - Different (advanced) optimization algorithms.\n",
    "- If your algorithm has a high variance:\n",
    "  - More data.\n",
    "  - Try regularization.\n",
    "  - Try a different model that is suitable for your data.\n",
    "- You should try the previous two points until you have a low bias and low variance.\n",
    "- In the older days before deep learning, there was a \"Bias/variance tradeoff\". But because now you have more options/tools for solving the bias and variance problem its really helpful to use deep learning.\n",
    "- Training a bigger neural network never hurts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding regularization to NN will help it reduce variance (overfitting)\n",
    "- L1 matrix norm:\n",
    "  - `||W|| = Sum(|w[i,j]|)  # sum of absolute values of all w`\n",
    "- L2 matrix norm because of arcane technical math reasons is called Frobenius norm:\n",
    "  - `||W||^2 = Sum(|w[i,j]|^2)\t# sum of all w squared`\n",
    "  - Also can be calculated as `||W||^2 = W.T * W`\n",
    "- Regularization for logistic regression:\n",
    "  - The normal cost function that we want to minimize is: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y(i),y'(i)))`\n",
    "  - The L2 regularization version: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y(i),y'(i))) + (lambda/2m) * Sum(|w[i]|^2)`\n",
    "  - The L1 regularization version: `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y(i),y'(i))) + (lambda/2m) * Sum(|w[i]|)`\n",
    "  - The L1 regularization version makes a lot of w values become zeros, which makes the model size smaller.\n",
    "  - L2 regularization is being used much more often.\n",
    "  - `lambda` here is the regularization parameter (hyperparameter)\n",
    "- Regularization for NN:\n",
    "  - The normal cost function that we want to minimize is:   \n",
    "    `J(W1,b1...,WL,bL) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y(i),y'(i)))`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The L2 regularization version:   \n",
    "    `J(w,b) = (1/m) * Sum(L(y(i),y'(i))) + (lambda/2m) * Sum((||W[l]||^2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - We stack the matrix as one vector `(mn,1)` and then we apply `sqrt(w1^2 + w2^2.....)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - To do back propagation (old way):   \n",
    "    `dw[l] = (from back propagation)`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The new way:   \n",
    "    `dw[l] = (from back propagation) + lambda/m * w[l]`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - So plugging it in weight update step:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - ```\n",
    "      w[l] = w[l] - learning_rate * dw[l]\n",
    "           = w[l] - learning_rate * ((from back propagation) + lambda/m * w[l])\n",
    "           = w[l] - (learning_rate*lambda/m) * w[l] - learning_rate * (from back propagation) \n",
    "           = (1 - (learning_rate*lambda)/m) * w[l] - learning_rate * (from back propagation)\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In practice this penalizes large weights and effectively limits the freedom in your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The new term `(1 - (learning_rate*lambda)/m) * w[l]`  causes the **weight to decay** in proportion to its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why regularization reduces overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some intuitions:\n",
    "  - Intuition 1:\n",
    "     - If `lambda` is too large - a lot of w's will be close to zeros which will make the NN simpler (you can think of it as it would behave closer to logistic regression).\n",
    "     - If `lambda` is good enough it will just reduce some weights that makes the neural network overfit.\n",
    "  - Intuition 2 (with _tanh_ activation function):\n",
    "     - If `lambda` is too large, w's will be small (close to zero) - will use the linear part of the _tanh_ activation function, so we will go from non linear activation to _roughly_ linear which would make the NN a _roughly_ linear classifier.\n",
    "     - If `lambda` good enough it will just make some of _tanh_ activations _roughly_ linear which will prevent overfitting.\n",
    "     \n",
    "_**Implementation tip**_: if you implement gradient descent, one of the steps to debug gradient descent is to plot the cost function J as a function of the number of iterations of gradient descent and you want to see that the cost function J decreases **monotonically** after every elevation of gradient descent with regularization. If you plot the old definition of J (no regularization) then you might not see it decrease monotonically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "- In most cases Andrew Ng tells that he uses the L2 regularization.\n",
    "- The dropout regularization eliminates some neurons/weights on each iteration based on a probability.\n",
    "- A most common technique to implement dropout is called \"Inverted dropout\".\n",
    "- Code for Inverted dropout:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  keep_prob = 0.8   # 0 <= keep_prob <= 1\n",
    "  l = 3  # this code is only for layer 3\n",
    "  # the generated number that are less than 0.8 will be dropped. 80% stay, 20% dropped\n",
    "  d3 = np.random.rand(a[l].shape[0], a[l].shape[1]) < keep_prob\n",
    "\n",
    "  a3 = np.multiply(a3,d3)   # keep only the values in d3\n",
    "\n",
    "  # increase a3 to not reduce the expected value of output\n",
    "  # (ensures that the expected value of a3 remains the same) - to solve the scaling problem\n",
    "  a3 = a3 / keep_prob       \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Vector d[l] is used for forward and back propagation and is the same for them, but it is different for each iteration (pass) or training example.\n",
    "- At test time we don't use dropout. If you implement dropout at test time - it would add noise to predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the previous video, the intuition was that dropout randomly knocks out units in your network. So it's as if on every iteration you're working with a smaller NN, and so using a smaller NN seems like it should have a regularizing effect.\n",
    "- Another intuition: can't rely on any one feature, so have to spread out weights.\n",
    "- It's possible to show that dropout has a similar effect to L2 regularization.\n",
    "- Dropout can have different `keep_prob` per layer.\n",
    "- The input layer dropout has to be near 1 (or 1 - no dropout) because you don't want to eliminate a lot of features.\n",
    "- If you're more worried about some layers overfitting than others, you can set a lower `keep_prob` for some layers than others. The downside is, this gives you even more hyperparameters to search for using cross-validation. One other alternative might be to have some layers where you apply dropout and some layers where you don't apply dropout and then just have one hyperparameter, which is a `keep_prob` for the layers for which you do apply dropouts.\n",
    "- A lot of researchers are using dropout with Computer Vision (CV) because they have a very big input size and almost never have enough data, so overfitting is the usual problem. And dropout is a regularization technique to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- A downside of dropout is that the cost function J is not well defined and it will be hard to debug (plot J by iteration).\n",
    "  - To solve that you'll need to turn off dropout, set all the `keep_prob`s to 1, and then run the code and check that it monotonically decreases J and then turn on the dropouts again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other regularization methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data augmentation**:\n",
    "  - For example in a computer vision data:\n",
    "    - You can flip all your pictures horizontally this will give you m more data instances.\n",
    "    - You could also apply a random position and rotation to an image to get more data.\n",
    "  - For example in OCR, you can impose random rotations and distortions to digits/letters.\n",
    "  - New data obtained using this technique isn't as good as the real independent data, but still can be used as a regularization technique.\n",
    "- **Early stopping**:\n",
    "  - In this technique we plot the training set and the dev set cost together for each iteration. At some iteration the dev set cost will stop decreasing and will start increasing.\n",
    "  - We will pick the point at which the training set error and dev set error are best (lowest training cost with lowest dev cost).\n",
    "  - We will take these parameters as the best parameters.\n",
    "    - ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/2-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/Images//02-_Early_stopping.png)\n",
    "  - Andrew prefers to use L2 regularization instead of early stopping because this technique simultaneously tries to minimize the cost function and not to overfit which contradicts the orthogonalization approach (will be discussed further).\n",
    "  - But its advantage is that you don't need to search a hyperparameter like in other regularization approaches (like `lambda` in L2 regularization).\n",
    "- **Model Ensembles**:\n",
    "  - Algorithm:\n",
    "    - Train multiple independent models.\n",
    "    - At test time average their results.\n",
    "  - It can get you extra 2% performance.\n",
    "  - It reduces the generalization error.\n",
    "  - You can use some snapshots of your NN at the training ensembles them and take the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalizing inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you normalize your inputs this will speed up the training process a lot.\n",
    "- Normalization are going on these steps:\n",
    "  1. Get the mean of the training set: `mean = (1/m) * sum(x(i))`\n",
    "  2. Subtract the mean from each input: `X = X - mean`\n",
    "     - This makes your inputs centered around 0.\n",
    "  3. Get the variance of the training set: `variance = (1/m) * sum(x(i)^2)`\n",
    "  4. Normalize the variance. `X /= variance`\n",
    "- These steps should be applied to training, dev, and testing sets (but using mean and variance of the train set).\n",
    "- Why normalize?\n",
    "  - If we don't normalize the inputs our cost function will be deep and its shape will be inconsistent (elongated) then optimizing it will take a long time.\n",
    "  - But if we normalize it the opposite will occur. The shape of the cost function will be consistent (look more symmetric like circle in 2D example) and we can use a larger learning rate alpha - the optimization will be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vanishing / Exploding gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Vanishing / Exploding gradients occurs when your derivatives become very small or very big.\n",
    "- To understand the problem, suppose that we have a deep neural network with number of layers L, and all the activation functions are **linear** and each `b = 0`\n",
    "  - Then:   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Y' = W[L]W[L-1].....W[2]W[1]X\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  - Then, if we have 2 hidden units per layer and x1 = x2 = 1, we result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    if W[l] = [1.5   0] \n",
    "              [0   1.5] (l != L because of different dimensions in the output layer)\n",
    "    Y' = W[L] [1.5  0]^(L-1) X = 1.5^L \t# which will be very large\n",
    "              [0  1.5]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    if W[l] = [0.5  0]\n",
    "              [0  0.5]\n",
    "    Y' = W[L] [0.5  0]^(L-1) X = 0.5^L \t# which will be very small\n",
    "              [0  0.5]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- The last example explains that the activations (and similarly derivatives) will be decreased/increased exponentially as a function of number of layers.\n",
    "- So If W > I (Identity matrix) the activation and gradients will explode.\n",
    "- And If W < I (Identity matrix) the activation and gradients will vanish.\n",
    "- Recently Microsoft trained 152 layers (ResNet)! which is a really big number. With such a deep neural network, if your activations or gradients increase or decrease exponentially as a function of L, then these values could get really big or really small. And this makes training difficult, especially if your gradients are exponentially smaller than L, then gradient descent will take tiny little steps. It will take a long time for gradient descent to learn anything.\n",
    "- There is a partial solution that doesn't completely solve this problem but it helps a lot - careful choice of how you initialize the weights (next video).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight Initialization for Deep Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- A partial solution to the Vanishing / Exploding gradients in NN is better or more careful choice of the random initialization of weights\n",
    "- In a single neuron (Perceptron model): `Z = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wnxn`\n",
    "  - So if `n_x` is large we want `W`'s to be smaller to not explode the cost.\n",
    "- So it turns out that we need the variance which equals `1/n_x` to be the range of `W`'s\n",
    "- So lets say when we initialize `W`'s like this (better to use with `tanh` activation):   \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  np.random.rand(shape) * np.sqrt(1/n[l-1])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  or variation of this (Bengio et al.):   \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  np.random.rand(shape) * np.sqrt(2/(n[l-1] + n[l]))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Setting initialization part inside sqrt to `2/n[l-1]` for `ReLU` is better:   \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  np.random.rand(shape) * np.sqrt(2/n[l-1])\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Number 1 or 2 in the nominator can also be a hyperparameter to tune (but not the first to start with)\n",
    "- This is one of the best way of partially solution to Vanishing / Exploding gradients (ReLU + Weight Initialization with variance) which will help gradients not to vanish/explode too quickly\n",
    "- The initialization in this video is called \"He Initialization / Xavier Initialization\" and has been published in 2015 paper.\n",

    "  - First take `W[1],b[1],...,W[L],b[L]` and reshape into one big vector (`theta`)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Don't use the gradient checking algorithm at training time because it's very slow.\n",
    "- Use gradient checking only for debugging.\n",
    "- If algorithm fails grad check, look at components to try to identify the bug.\n",
    "- Don't forget to add `lamda/(2m) * sum(W[l])` to `J` if you are using L1 or L2 regularization.\n",
    "- Gradient checking doesn't work with dropout because J is not consistent. \n",
    "  - You can first turn off dropout (set `keep_prob = 1.0`), run gradient checking and then turn on dropout again.\n",
    "- Run gradient checking at random initialization and train the network for a while maybe there's a bug which can be seen when w's and b's become larger (further from 0) and can't be seen on the first iteration (when w's and b's are very small).\n",

    "### Initialization summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- The weights $W^{[l]}$ should be initialized randomly to break symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is however okay to initialize the biases $b^{[l]}$ to zeros. Symmetry is still broken so long as $W^{[l]}$ is initialized randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Different initializations lead to different results\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random initialization is used to break symmetry and make sure different hidden units can learn different things\n",

    "- Don't intialize to values that are too large\n",
    "\n",
    "- He initialization works well for networks with ReLU activations. \n",

    "### Regularization summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. L2 Regularization   \n",
    "**Observations**:   \n",
    "  - The value of λ is a hyperparameter that you can tune using a dev set.\n",
    "  - L2 regularization makes your decision boundary smoother. If λ is too large, it is also possible to \"oversmooth\", resulting in a model with high bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is L2-regularization actually doing?**:   \n",
    "  - L2-regularization relies on the assumption that a model with small weights is simpler than a model with large weights. Thus, by penalizing the square values of the weights in the cost function you drive all the weights to smaller values. It becomes too costly for the cost to have large weights! This leads to a smoother model in which the output changes more slowly as the input changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you should remember:**   \n",
    "Implications of L2-regularization on:\n",
    "  - cost computation:\n",
    "    - A regularization term is added to the cost\n",
    "  - backpropagation function:\n",
    "    - There are extra terms in the gradients with respect to weight matrices\n",
    "  - weights:\n",
    "    - weights end up smaller (\"weight decay\") - are pushed to smaller values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2. Dropout   \n",
    "**What you should remember about dropout:**   \n",
    "- Dropout is a regularization technique.\n",
    "- You only use dropout during training. Don't use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) during test time.\n",
    "- Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.\n",
    "- During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep_prob to keep the same expected value for the activations. For example, if `keep_prob` is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence, the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this works even when keep_prob is other values than 0.5.\n",

    "- Using batch norm in 3 hidden layers NN:\n",
    "    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashishpatel26/DeepLearning.ai-Summary/master/2-%20Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/Images//bn.png)\n",
    "- Our NN parameters will be:\n",
    "  - `W[1]`, `b[1]`, ..., `W[L]`, `b[L]`, `beta[1]`, `gamma[1]`, ..., `beta[L]`, `gamma[L]`\n",
    "  - `beta[1]`, `gamma[1]`, ..., `beta[L]`, `gamma[L]` are updated using any optimization algorithms (like GD, RMSprop, Adam)\n",
    "- If you are using a deep learning framework, you won't have to implement batch norm yourself:\n",
    "  - Ex. in Tensorflow you can add this line: `tf.nn.batch-normalization()`\n",
    "- Batch normalization is usually applied with mini-batches.\n",
    "- If we are using batch normalization parameters `b[1]`, ..., `b[L]` doesn't count because they will be eliminated after mean subtraction step, so:\n",

    "- So if you are using batch normalization, you can remove b[l] or make it always zero.\n",

    "  - `Z[l]       - (n[l], m)`\n",
    "  - `beta[l]    - (n[l], m)`\n",
    "  - `gamma[l]   - (n[l], m)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does Batch normalization work?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first reason is the same reason as why we normalize X.\n",
    "- The second reason is that batch normalization reduces the problem of input values changing (shifting).\n",
    "- Batch normalization does some regularization:\n",
    "  - Each mini batch is scaled by the mean/variance computed of that mini-batch.\n",
    "  - This adds some noise to the values `Z[l]` within that mini batch. So similar to dropout it adds some noise to each hidden layer's activations.\n",
    "  - This has a slight regularization effect.\n",
    "  - Using bigger size of the mini-batch you are reducing noise and therefore regularization effect.\n",
    "  - Don't rely on batch normalization as a regularization. It's intended for normalization of hidden units, activations and therefore speeding up learning. For regularization use other regularization techniques (L2 or dropout).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch normalization at test time\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we train a NN with Batch normalization, we compute the mean and the variance of the mini-batch.\n",
    "- In testing we might need to process examples one at a time. The mean and the variance of one example won't make sense.\n",
    "- We have to compute an estimated value of mean and variance to use it in testing time.\n",
    "- We can use the weighted average across the mini-batches.\n",
    "- We will use the estimated values of the mean and variance to test.\n",
    "- This method is also sometimes called \"Running average\".\n",
    "- In practice most often you will use a deep learning framework and it will contain some default implementation of doing such a thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Softmax Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- In every example we have used so far we were talking about binary classification.\n",
    "- There are a generalization of logistic regression called Softmax regression that is used for multiclass classification/regression.\n",
    "- For example if we are classifying by classes `dog`, `cat`, `baby chick` and `none of that`\n",
    "  - Dog `class = 1`\n",
    "  - Cat `class = 2`\n",
    "  - Baby chick `class = 3`\n",
    "  - None `class = 0`\n",
    "  - To represent a dog vector `y = [0 1 0 0]`\n",
    "  - To represent a cat vector `y = [0 0 1 0]`\n",
    "  - To represent a baby chick vector `y = [0 0 0 1]`\n",

    "  - In output layer `Ny = C`\n",
    "- Each of C values in the output layer will contain a probability of the example to belong to each of the classes.\n",
    "- In the last layer we will have to activate the Softmax activation function instead of the sigmoid activation.\n",
    "- Softmax activation equations:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  t = e^(Z[L])                      # shape(C, m)\n",
    "  A[L] = e^(Z[L]) / sum(t)          # shape(C, m), sum(t) - sum of t's for each example (shape (1, m))\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training a Softmax classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's an activation which is called hard max, which gets 1 for the maximum value and zeros for the others.\n",
    "  - If you are using NumPy, its `np.max` over the vertical axis.\n",
    "- The Softmax name came from softening the values and not harding them like hard max.\n",
    "- Softmax is a generalization of logistic activation function to `C` classes. If `C = 2` softmax reduces to logistic regression.\n",
    "- The loss function used with softmax:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  L(y, y_hat) = - sum(y[j] * log(y_hat[j])) # j = 0 to C-1\n",

    "- In TensorFlow you implement only the forward propagation and TensorFlow will do the backpropagation by itself.\n",
    "- In TensorFlow a placeholder is a variable you can assign a value to later.\n",
    "- If you are using a mini-batch training you should change the `feed_dict={x: coefficients}` to the current mini-batch data.\n",

    "  ```\n",
    "- In deep learning frameworks there are a lot of things that you can do with one line of code like changing the optimizer.\n",
    "_**Side notes:**_\n",
    "- Writing and running programs in TensorFlow has the following steps:\n",
    "  1. Create Tensors (variables) that are not yet executed/evaluated.\n",
    "  2. Write operations between those Tensors.\n",
    "  3. Initialize your Tensors.\n",
    "  4. Create a Session.\n",
    "  5. Run the Session. This will run the operations you'd written above.\n",
    "- Instead of needing to write code to compute the cost function we know, we can use this line in TensorFlow :\n",
    "  `tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits = ...,  labels = ...)`\n",
    "- To initialize weights in NN using TensorFlow use:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  W1 = tf.get_variable(\"W1\", [25,12288], initializer = tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(seed = 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "  b1 = tf.get_variable(\"b1\", [25,1], initializer = tf.zeros_initializer())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- For 3-layer NN, it is important to note that the forward propagation stops at `Z3`. The reason is that in TensorFlow the last linear layer output is given as input to the function computing the loss. Therefore, you don't need `A3`!\n",
    "- To reset the graph use `tf.reset_default_graph()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extra Notes\n",
